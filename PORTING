Porting Fuse
============

Sorry, at the moment this isn't a helpful guide as to what you need to do
to port Fuse to a new platform.

Unfortunately, various people have failed to read and understand the GNU
General Public License (see 'COPYING') before porting Fuse, so this is a
very brief guide to what you can and can't do with Fuse's code:

* If you release a binary of Fuse, you *must* release *all* the source
  code you used to create it at the same time. "Soon" or "when I've
  tidied up the code" is NOT acceptable.

* If you use any code which you haven't written yourself, it must be
  available under a licence compatible with the GPL. As an example, this
  means you may *not* use any code which "may not be used for commercial
  purposes". Any code which is licenced under the GPL (v2), the modified
  BSD license or which is truly in the public domain is OK.

Note that above is not an exhaustive list of what you can and cannot
do with Fuse's code. For the full details, see the GPL.
