Some thanks (in alphabetical order):

* Stuart Brady: for the Scorpion emulation and HP-UX sound support
  (see `AUTHORS')

* Michael Bukin: for XWinAllegro, which was used by previous versions of
  Fuse for the graphical display.
  (http://web.archive.org/web/19990210094206/http://www.canvaslink.com/allegro/xwinallegro/)

* Ian Collier: the source to his xz80
  (http://web.archive.org/web/19990428010016/http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/users/ian.collier/Spectrum/index.html)
  was very helpful for getting the z80 opcodes right; also the ZX Printer
  emulation is based on xz80's.

* Boris Donko: for various Z80 core fixes: missing memory contention
  on LD (nnnn),A instruction, flags on SCF and FLAG_V on DEC, and
  timing of INC SP.

* John Elliott: for lib765, which provides Fuse's emulation of the +3's
  FDC, and libdsk which provides support for more disk image formats:
  see http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/

* Ivan Ruiz Etxabe: for helping test RZX competition mode recording.

* Martin Garton: making the GTK+ user interface compatible with GTK+ 2.0,
  although I then went and broke it in other ways.

* Ian Greenway: for information about reading from unattached ports. If
  you've got an Amiga, you may well like to check out Ian's Spectrum
  Emulator, ASp: http://www.lasernet.plus.com/asp.html

* Shawn Hargreaves: for Allegro (http://liballeg.org/)
  (again, used by previous versions of Fuse for the graphical display)

* Steven Harrison: for helping track down why the SDL sound routines
  weren't working on IRIX.

* Thomas Harte: for the much faster console display routines (Not present
  in the current version).

* Erik Kunze: for lots of helpful hints on how to program under Unix.

* Garry Lancaster: for the simple 8-bit IDE, ZXATASP and ZXCF
  emulations (see `AUTHORS')

* Gerton Lunter: his wonderful z80
  (http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/pc/windows/z80-400.zip)
  got me started on this emulation lark all those years ago...

* Anders Holmberg: for reporting a bug in the z80 v1.45 load routines. Anders
  has done what is basically a port of Fuse 0.4.0 to the PocketPC: see
  http://pocketclive.emuunlim.com/

* Russell Marks: for various bits of code (see `AUTHORS')

* Fredrick Meunier: for TC2048 support and more (see `AUTHORS')

* Catalin Mihaila: for writing an SDL user interface for Fuse. Not in
  the code as this has already been done by Fred :-(

* David Muriel: for helping test RZX competition mode recording.

* Santiago Romero: for putting me on the track of a bug in Fuse's keyboard
  emulation.

* Mark Round: for reporting a bug with respect to Solaris sound detection.

* Darren Salt: quite a few bits of code (see `AUTHORS')

* Dmitry Sanarin: the author of Glukalka (http://www.sanarin.ru/glukalka/),
  from which Fuse's TR-DOS emulation code was taken.

* Steve Snake (via Mark Woodmass): for pointing out which memory pages
  on the 128K machine are actually contended. Grab Steve's emulator, Klive,
  from http://www.worldofspectrum.org/emulators.html#pcwin

* Ludvig Strigeus and The ScummVM project wrote the original version of
  the code which is used as the graphics scalers. For ScummVM, check out
  http://www.scummvm.org/

* Gergely Szasz: Interface 1/Microdrive emulation, the 'movie' code and the
  ao sound driver (see `AUTHORS')

* Miklos Szeredi: his `SpectEmu'
  (http://web.archive.org/web/20100408033206/http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/spectemu/)
  gave the inspiration for an important rewrite of the Z80 core, and was
  also _very_ useful whilst trying to track down some bugs.

* Martijn van der Heide: for World of Spectrum
  (http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) -- simply the best Speccy Web site out
  there.

* Witold Filipczyk: for TC2068 support and more (see `AUTHORS')

* Mark Woodmass: for putting me on the track of (and finding the
  solution to) bugs with regard to Fuse's R register emulation during
  HALTs and interrupts and Fuse's mask for the memory control port on
  the 128K/+2 machines. Mark's another one who's written an emulator:
  see 'SPIN' at http://www.worldofspectrum.org/emulators.html#pcwin

* Alexander Yurchenko: for the OpenBSD/Solaris sound code (see `AUTHORS')

* Matan Ziv-Av: for various bits of code (see `AUTHORS')
